Hi there üëã

#### I'm a postdoc in [Ferguson lab](https://www.ferglab.com), PME @UChicago.

I‚Äôm currently working on
  - :gear: Implementing enhanced sampling methods in [SSAGES](https://github.com/SSAGESproject/SSAGES).
  - :microscope: Exploring assembly of like charged dielectric nanoparticles.

I use
  - `Python` `C++` `Fortran` `MATLAB` `R` `html`
  - [`GROMACS`](https://manual.gromacs.org) [`LAMMPS`](https://lammps.sandia.gov)
  - [`SSAGES`](https://ssagesproject.github.io) [`PLUMED`](https://www.plumed.org)
  - Gaussian process regression: [GPyTorch](https://gpytorch.ai) and [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/).

I am interested in
  - Application of data-driven approaches to address real-world problems.
  - Statistical mechanics and Probability.
  - Molecular simulations and enhanced sampling approaches.
  - Deep learning.
  - Coding.
